             when in the course of human evnets, it <strong>becomes necessary</strong>
             for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another,
             and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station
             to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect
             to opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which imppel
             them to the separation. perchance.
