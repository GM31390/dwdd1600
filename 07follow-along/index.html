        Our story
    </h1>
    <p>
        I was born at a very young age, this affected me so greatly I didn't speak to my parents for 2 years

    </p>
    <p>eventually when I got older I got into baking through watching how 2 basic videos. that was the birthplace of our coveted blue strawberries</p>
    <p> after an incedint involving mustard gas and a toilet, my mother took me to train under gordan ramsey.</p>
    <p>There he taught me the secrets to refining my craft, and also helped me not send someone to the hospital every time they eat a blue strawberry</p>
    <p>now with the help of my leagally questionable father, i started this bakery to share my skills with the world.</p>
